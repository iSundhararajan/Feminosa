# Feminosa

## 💡 Inspiration

Feminine hygiene products are very important in women's lives as it keeps them healthy and prevents infections. However, more than 97% of women in rural areas do not have access to these products and often rely on unhygienic means. Furthermore, the stigma and stereotype around this topic prevents them from getting the necessary help. This inspired us to create Feminosa, which is a web app that helps to end period poverty.

## 💻 What it does

Feminosa is a web app that helps end period poverty by offering feminine hygiene products to women, free of cost. This is mainly intended for rural women, who have limited access to these necessary supplies. When the user arrives to the website, they will be taken to the homepage, which gives more details about this initiative. The user can browse for products and can donate to charities which help women in rural areas; this secure payment process will be powered by Hedera. Moreover, there is also tips on how women can be safe and has an SOS button, in case immediate help is needed.
